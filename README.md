### Getting started

I use `yarn`, but you can just use `npm` just as well for this. It's just a simple compiler for flat pages. Nothing special, but it makes life so much easier than doing everything inline.

It has the added bonus of being able to serve itself as well with browserSync

So clone the repo into your local folder.

run either of the following commands

`yarn`

or

`npm install`

This will install the dependencies you may need.

Once that has completed (potentially about a minute, but can sometimes take longer).

You can fire up the base code with:

`npm run start`

or

`yarn start`

This will compile all the scripts and open in your default browser.

There is also a `build` script in there which is just for building out the files without serving them.

I find it useful for zipping up the files. Just replace `start` with `build` with either of the above commands. I used to have a zip file, but find it best to do this manually.
